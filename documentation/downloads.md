# Try Q OS Without Downloading Source Files

If you came here because you just want to try out Q OS without having to do complex compiling or setup on your computer, this page has exactly waht you are looking for.

## Download the latest <code>Q-OS.iso</code> release

If you want to try Q OS inside a virtual machine or burn it to a CD/USB, click [here](https://github.com/raphydaphy/Q-Operating-System/releases/). That link will take you to the GitHub Releases page for Q OS where you can click on the `.iso` link closest to the top of the page. This will always be the most recently released `.iso` file and you ean easily test it on your own computer without having to compile the code yourself.

Note that this will not be the most recently compiled version of Q OS - this file will only be the most recently created version that is part of a `release`. Luckily, we make releases almost twice every week so it should be a pretty recent `.iso` image of Q OS and not too different from what you can compile from the source code.

## Download versions of Q OS older than the latest release

If you are interested in trying ancient versions of Q OS, we have made some downloads avalable for every GitHub release of Q OS, as in version 0.01, 0.02 and so on. You can get them by going to the [Q OS Releases](https://github.com/raphydaphy/Q-Operating-System/releases/) page on GitHub, or clicking that link. Just choose the version of Q OS you want to download in the sidebar and you can download it in <code>.iso</code>, <code>.zip</code> or <code>.tar.gz</code> format.
